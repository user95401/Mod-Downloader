# Mod Downloader

Small tool for devs to download and install mod in game.

Just paste link for file in the search input from geode mods layer (list).

You can set exact name of file that will be downloaded: 
```
put ^ char as separator
fe: https://hi.lnk/mks314a.geode^ermo.gmd_sex.geode
```

<img src="logo.png" width="150" alt="the mod's logo" />

*Updated logo.png to change mod's icon (yippee)*
